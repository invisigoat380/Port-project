                I have been studying web development for roughly 1 year, and have earned a
                professional certification in web development as well. I initially started
                this project during my 3rd week of practice and finished it on my one year mark.
                (September 15, 2022-September 15, 2023)!

                I like using VS code for my projects mainly because it is the second ide I had 
                ever used aside from intlijidea. It caught my eye and had many features that I
                had never seen before that were very useful for both ease of use and personalization.
